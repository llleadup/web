# LinkedIn for B2B Sales. 1 000 000$ on sales

In fact, LinkedIn is the best sales channel in B2B. Just imagine this is a social network with 1 billion people, a quarter of whom are entrepreneurs, and the same number are decision-makers. All of them strive to earn more money and get more connections that can help them in their development.

LinkedIn's strategy consists of several channels:

- Connections
- InMail newsletter (Sales Navigator)
- Content marketing

Let's go through each.

## Connections

On LinkedIn, your contacts are called connections. Profiles with up to 500 connections are not taken seriously, so the first 150 connections may be a little difficult to get. However, it becomes easier over time, and you may even find yourself overwhelmed with connection requests. It's advisable to make targeted connections right from the start with people who are theoretically your leads. You can write a greeting message with the connection request. Under no circumstances should you sell directly; everyone is tired of that. Try to provide value from the first message (for example, by sharing research relevant to the lead’s industry).

## InMail Mailing List

This feature is available with a LinkedIn Premium subscription, which is quite expensive but worth it. With it, you can collect people using all filters and send them a newsletter. Again, don't sell directly. Develop a chain of emails in which you gradually lead a person to your product, providing value in the form of a presentation, research, etc., before making a sales pitch.

## Content Marketing

You can create posts and thereby grow your audience. It’s easier to gain views on this social network, as it’s relatively easy to grow connections here. Regularly post valuable content to engage your audience and build your reputation as a thought leader in your industry.

## Key Takeaways

Know that LinkedIn is the best social network for concluding large contracts. Don’t forget to do analytics, change your message, and perhaps create several lead magnets to try and promote each one!
