# Fiverr

The main advantage is that it works in reverse. The customer is included in the contractor’s grid, and your profile either has a large number of reviews and good SEO optimized, or is at the bottom and is not displayed in the first lines

**Pros:**
- **Service Based**: Fiverr is great for offering specific services (gigs) at set prices, which can make the purchasing process easier for customers.
- **Easy to Use**: The platform is user-friendly, making it easy to set up and start selling your services.
- **Global Reach**: Fiverr has a large and diverse customer base from all over the world, providing ample opportunities.

**Minuses:**
- **Low starting prices**. Services often start at $5, which can lead to your work being undervalued and your income lower.
- **High competition**: the platform is oversaturated with freelancers, so it’s difficult to stand out and attract clients.
- **Commissions**: Fiverr charges a 20% commission on all transactions, which can significantly cut into your profits.
