# Paid adversting and SEO

Are these two completely different channels in the same stage? This is not a mistake, in fact these two channels are very effective on high budgets.

## Paid advertising

Paid advertising can attract clients to different types of lead magnets and social media users may be interested in your product, but are not ready to buy now. Google Ads is a very good channel for attracting traffic to the site, but in order to attract a client in the B2B segment you need to spend enough money, and you can always test which combination will bring you the most leads to the site

## SEO

In fact, SEO is also a very good promotion channel, but the niche that we are looking at is very competitive and in order to be above everyone else you need to grow your website to incredible sizes and make it more of a forum or a news blog in order to rank for queries

These are both very good marketing channels, but when scaling the agency, and not at the start. At the start you need to sell cold, no matter how much you want it
