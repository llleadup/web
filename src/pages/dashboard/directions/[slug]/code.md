Creating a landing page by coding it yourself allows for more flexibility and customization, but requires more technical knowledge and resources. 

I think that you already know what to do with the code if you have opened this stage. You will need to carefully read about SEO in the following sections if you decide to do so.

# Target Action
Before creating a landing page, identify the primary action you want users to take: buy, order, subscribe, request a callback, etc. A landing page is only effective if your offer can be encapsulated in one clear call-to-action (CTA).

# Secrets of an Effective Landing Page

### Know Your Customer
Use the persona method: create profiles of your ideal customers and look at your site through their eyes. What questions do they have? What do they want and fear? For example, when creating a landing page for the Marshal Apart-Hotel, we developed profiles of potential customers.

### Help Users Make Decisions
Build a coherent structure and tell your story sequentially. Each section should gradually lead the customer to the target action, answering their questions and dispelling doubts. The persona method from the previous point will help here. Gather all the information your customer wants to know, and you'll have a compelling structure.

### Example Structure for a Landing Page
Here’s an example structure based on our project for the vending service "Here.Food":

1. **First Screen**
   - A vibrant first screen with a call to action and a slogan that characterizes the company’s activity.

2. **Description**
   - A brief description of the service with an appealing design. Avoid walls of text; instead, use an original format that ensures readability.

3. **Advantages**
   - List the real benefits of the company. People no longer trust generic terms like "customer-oriented" or "professionalism." Instead, they want to see real, clearly stated advantages.

4. **Workflow**
   - Provide answers to customer questions about how the service works in a clear, easy-to-understand format.

5. **Pricing**
   - Include information on pricing and usage terms. Respect your customers: if you're selling something, disclose the price. The customer will eventually find out, and withholding this information risks wasting time and leaving a negative impression.

6. **Target Action**
   - Include a form and a button with minimal fields for ease of use. The fewer fields, the higher the likelihood of completion.

### Launch Advertising
Visitors won't appear out of nowhere; you need advertising. This is a vast topic worthy of many articles. Here are a few key points:

#### Click Map
A click map helps you identify which buttons users click and which they ignore. If users frequently click on an icon that isn’t a button, it indicates a need for more information and a better design. Add the necessary info and redesign the icon to improve clarity.

#### Scroll Map
A scroll map shows which information users pay attention to and where they spend time. Important elements (buttons/text) from unpopular sections should be moved to more visible areas. Reevaluate or remove sections that users skip. If users don't scroll through even half of your page, it indicates the need for a significant redesign.

### Conclusion
A good landing page is built around a clearly defined target action. All sections should guide the user toward this action. Create detailed customer profiles to understand their needs and perspectives. Properly set up and launch advertising, as your target audience is unlikely to find you on their own. Continuously improve your landing page based on statistics, using tools like click and scroll maps.


Creating a landing page is quite a risky idea. Since you may not have enough energy for other things, but if you already have experience in website development and you know what works and what doesn’t, then that’s great, use it! Most likely, with the right skills, you will make the best website for yourself, since no one understands your business like you
