## Freelance work

Taking on a security contract as a freelancer is like fastening your seat belt before you hit the road: it's about protecting yourself and your client, ensuring a smooth onward journey. Let's break this down into simpler terms, shall we?

### Introducing the players

First, let's find out who is involved in this. You have you, the freelancer and the client. Think of it as a partnership in which both parties need to look out for each other.

###Setting the scene

You have your own job, right? This part describes in detail what you will do and when. It's like drawing a map so everyone knows where they're going.

### Stay safe and sound

Now let's talk about safety. Just like wearing a hard hat on a construction site, this section outlines rules to keep everyone safe from danger. We're talking about information privacy, data protection and making sure no one gets hurt - physically or financially.

### Receiving payment

Talk about money. It's like agreeing on a price before getting into a taxi. You need to be clear about how much you are being paid, when you are getting paid, and what will happen if someone is late on payment.

### Working with drama

Just in case things don't go according to plan, this section describes how you'll make things right. It's like having a referee in a game: a person who makes sure everything is fair and just.


So, here it is - your security contract, humanized and ready to use. Remember, it's all about clarity, communication, and caring for each other every step of the way. You can get an example of a contract from colleagues, a lawyer, or adapt any contract for the provision of services to yourself
