# Service segment analysis

Choosing the right service segment requires careful consideration of various factors, such as market demand, the skills of your team, and your business goals. Enjoy

### What services to choose?
It really depends on what you like. If you decide to make software, and on weekends you like to play football, then start knocking on local teams to do automated accounting for their club. If you decide to work on websites, but you also like to play football, then go to the teams and convince them that they need a website, because they will not attract players and advertising contracts without a good website!

### How to understand that there is demand?

A superficial market analysis can be done from home. Just by looking at freelance exchanges and IT ratings. If you superficially understand that there is demand, then it’s worth trying to start. Next, go deeper into the niche. Go to events, listen to people, collaborate with other studios or related industries

Based on these factors, just dive into the segment and don’t get scattered. It is very important not to spread yourself across all niches. You don't do everything. Yes, now you will give up earning money, but in the future you will be more expensive than anyone else on the market in your business
