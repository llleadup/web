# B2B or B2C

**B2B** (Business to Business) and **B2C** (Business to Consumer) are two different types of company designs.

B2B involves transactions between companies, such as when a manufacturer offers products to a store. Advertising and marketing techniques focus on developing partnerships, emphasizing the value of the product, and often entail longer sales cycles along with increased ticket availability. The decision-making process typically consists of multiple stakeholders, and promotional initiatives are more data-driven and individualized.

B2C, on the other hand, involves marketing directly to customers. This design focuses on the psychological allure of mass advertising as well as the convenience of the experience. B2C advertising and marketing methods typically consist of social media projects, direct advertising and marketing, and promotions aimed at quick conversion as well as impulse purchases.

The choice between B2B and B2C depends on your product and services, target market and service goals. Every call for customized advertising comes closer to properly reaching and attracting the relevant target markets.

**Dear readers**, if you go to B2B, you are still selling to a person. You are selling to a person who will choose between you and his dinner if it is a low bill. If this is a high check, then the person is not managing his budget and is managing fear, in this case your main task will be to remove his fear
