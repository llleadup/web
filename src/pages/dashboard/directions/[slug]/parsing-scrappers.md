# Scrappers

Scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. Parsers, also known as web scrapers or web crawlers, are automated tools or scripts designed to navigate web pages and extract specific information.

How they work:

1. **Data collection**. The scraper sends requests to a website, simulating the behavior of a regular user visiting web pages.

2. **Parsing the page**. After receiving HTML content, the parser parses the page to identify relevant data based on predefined rules or patterns, such as certain HTML tags, classes, or attributes.

3. **Data extraction**. The parser extracts the desired data elements such as text, images, links or structured data such as tables using methods such as regular expressions, XPath or CSS selectors.

4. **Data storage**. The extracted data is then stored in a structured format such as CSV, JSON or database for further processing or analysis.

Scrapers are used for:

**Lead Generation**: Collecting contact information or company information from directories, social media, or other sources for sales or marketing purposes.

It is important to note that while website scraping can be a powerful tool for collecting and analyzing data, it must be done ethically and in accordance with the website's terms of service and legal guidelines. Unauthorized website scraping can lead to legal problems and damage to your reputation.

There are a ton of such scrappers on the Internet and you can easily find them! The most effective way to do this is using Google maps or yellow pages!
