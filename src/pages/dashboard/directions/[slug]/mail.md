# Cold Mails

Cold mailings have always worked and will continue to work! Those who say that they don’t work simply didn’t try. Good luck!

### Don't overload the first email
Don't add links, attachments, PDF files, flashy animations! They distract from the text part and make spam filters distrustful. If you disobey advice, you will end up in Spam. Everything has its time! In the future, add graphic elements and attachments. The purpose of the first touch is to establish a connection with the public, and not to scare you with an abundance of files.

### What is the difference between a cold email and spam?
Capacity and brevity. People don't want to read paintings from an unknown sender. Be brief. Put yourself in the consumer’s shoes; this will help you look at the email through the eyes of the recipient. If you are interested in the offer, he will clarify the details.
Personalization. Address by name, address exclusively the target audience, indicate where you got their emails from. Use humor and a polite conversational style.
Don't be intrusive. Take care of the comfort of the recipients, do not try to immediately sell a product or service. Work on building your image. Second, send a letter about continued cooperation. The effectiveness of the subsequent campaign depends on the public's reaction to the first email.

Openness. Please provide your real email and sender's name. Anonymous messages from mysterious users increase mistrust and the risk of ending up in the Spam folder. Getting there is very easy, but getting out and restoring your reputation is not the easiest task.

Clarity: The topic should be clear. Study the list of spam words, avoid them in the body and subject of the email.

### B2B mailing: optimal size for cold email
Before writing the letter itself, let’s decide what size it should be and how many letters to send. As for length, the letter should never be too long. Otherwise, the recipient simply will not read it to the end. But at the same time, the volume should be sufficient to tell about your company and describe your offer.
- The optimal size is 1000 characters (about half a page).
- Maximum - 1500 characters. Cold emails
- Break the text into logical paragraphs.
- For long lists, format them in bulleted lists.
Thus, the text for cold mailing will not look like a continuous footcloth, difficult to read. The number of follow-up letters is 2-3. If you haven't received a response to the first one, please send a reminder email. If the second one remains unanswered, there is no point in sending more and disturbing the recipient. In rare cases, we send a third final one a week later.

### Structure of a sales letter for cold mailing
For many, the task of writing a text becomes overwhelming. You open the sheet and nothing comes to mind. Where to start and how to write an effective letter? Everything will become much easier and clearer if you know the classical structure and just follow it. So, a letter to a potential client has the following elements:
- Greetings.
- About yourself or the company
- Offer (what you offer a person)
- Call to action.
- Signature.

As you can see, there is nothing complicated here. Next, we will look step by step at how to write sales letters to conduct cold mailings with a detailed description of each element and examples. And you can easily write your first cold email.

### Formatting a letter: is a visual part necessary?
In cold emails, design does not play a decisive role. On the contrary, an overloaded sales letter template may not bring the desired effect. In addition, the purpose of such a letter is to create the feeling of a personal correspondence, and not a mass sales mailing. So keep the design as simple as possible:
- Don't add too many pictures.
- Firstly, email, in which there are more pictures than text, often immediately ends up in spam.
- Some email clients cut off messages that are too large. For example, Gmail often compresses images in messages larger than 102 kb. Therefore, the recipient may not see everything as you intended.
- Do not insert GIFs. Firstly, they take a long time to load and may not be displayed correctly at all. And secondly, they simply annoy people who receive email from your company for the first time.
The only thing that can (and even needs) to be added is a photo of the sender in the signature of the letter. In general, experiments with visuals are permissible and even necessary when sending letters to regular customers who have subscribed to the mailing list. After all, they will be bored of receiving the same text emails. But it’s better to make the cold letter template standard, with the simplest design possible (or you can do without it at all, just text and nothing extra).

### What's next?
If you don't get a response, wait a couple of days and then send another email. And so create a chain of 3-4 letters. Perhaps your lead will answer some. If not, then come up with a lead magnet “If you are interested, I would send you our research on how to increase sales by 50%”
